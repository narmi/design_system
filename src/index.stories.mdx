# Welcome to Narmi Design System

⚡ Build your own experiences on the [Narmi platform](https://www.narmi.com/developers/developer-portal)!

This framework provides low level utilities and UI components for building
custom experiences in combination with the [Narmi API](https://www.narmi.com/developers/developer-portal#api).

<hr style={{ borderWidth: "0", margin: "2rem 0" }} />

## Design Tokens

This framework uses Design Tokens to store standard values for spacing, colors, typography, and more.
These values are available as CSS custom properties provided by the `@narmi/design_system` stylesheet.

## Style

The Narmi Design System stylesheet also provides a set of global CSS classes that can be used for
typesetting, displaying icons, and adjusting other style properties. All CSS classes provided by this
framework apply standard values defined by Design Tokens.

## Components

UI Components are currently offered as React (Web) components. Direct control over styling
is limited by design, but [theming is supported](?path=/docs/design-tokens-color--theme).
